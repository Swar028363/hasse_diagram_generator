# Hasse Diagram Generator

This project generates Hasse diagrams for various relations, such as divisibility, subset, and comparison relations. The diagrams are visualized using `matplotlib` and `networkx`.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python Installation**:

    - Download and install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
    - Ensure that Python is added to your system's PATH during installation.

2. **Dependencies**:
    - The project requires the following Python libraries:
    - `networkx`
    - `matplotlib`

## Installation

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Swar028363/hasse_diagram_generator.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd hasse_diagram_generator
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies by running:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed as mentioned above.

2. Run the script to generate a Hasse diagram:

    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
